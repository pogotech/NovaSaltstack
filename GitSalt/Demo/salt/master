#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states
#
#file_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/salt

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server. The default is md5, but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#
# Prior to changing this value, the master should be stopped and all Salt 
# caches should be cleared.
#hash_type: md5

# The buffer size in the file server can be adjusted here:
#file_buffer_size: 1048576

# A regular expression (or a list of expressions) that will be matched
# against the file path before syncing the modules and states to the minions.
# This includes files affected by the file.recurse state.
# For example, if you manage your custom modules and states in subversion
# and don't want all the '.svn' folders and content synced to your minions,
# you could set this to '/\.svn($|/)'. By default nothing is ignored.
#file_ignore_regex:
#  - '/\.svn($|/)'
#  - '/\.git($|/)'

# A file glob (or list of file globs) that will be matched against the file
# path before syncing the modules and states to the minions. This is similar
# to file_ignore_regex above, but works on globs instead of regex. By default
# nothing is ignored.
# file_ignore_glob:
#  - '*.pyc'
#  - '*/somefolder/*.bak'
#  - '*.swp'

# File Server Backend

#
# The gitfs_ssl_verify option specifies whether to ignore ssl certificate
# errors when contacting the gitfs backend. You might want to set this to
# false if you're using a git backend that uses a self-signed certificate but
# keep in mind that setting this flag to anything other than the default of True
# is a security concern, you may want to try using the ssh transport.
#gitfs_ssl_verify: True
#
# The gitfs_root option gives the ability to serve files from a subdirectory
# within the repository. The path is defined relative to the root of the
# repository and defaults to the repository root.
#gitfs_root: somefolder/otherfolder

#####         Pillar settings        #####
##########################################
# Salt Pillars allow for the building of global data that can be made selectively
# available to different minions based on minion grain filtering. The Salt
# Pillar is laid out in the same fashion as the file server, with environments,
# a top file and sls files. However, pillar data does not need to be in the
# highstate format, and is generally just key/value pairs.
#pillar_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/pillar
#
ext_pillar:
  - git: master https://github.com/pogotech/NovaSaltstack.git root=GitSalt/remote-git/pillar

# The ext_pillar_first option allows for external pillar sources to populate
# before file system pillar. This allows for targeting file system pillar from
# ext_pillar.
#ext_pillar_first: False

# The pillar_gitfs_ssl_verify option specifies whether to ignore ssl certificate
# errors when contacting the pillar gitfs backend. You might want to set this to
# false if you're using a git backend that uses a self-signed certificate but
# keep in mind that setting this flag to anything other than the default of True
# is a security concern, you may want to try using the ssh transport.
#pillar_gitfs_ssl_verify: True

# The pillar_opts option adds the master configuration file data to a dict in
# the pillar called "master". This is used to set simple configurations in the
# master config file that can then be used on minions.
#pillar_opts: False

# The pillar_safe_render_error option prevents the master from passing piller
# render errors to the minion. This is set on by default because the error could
# contain templating data which would give that minion information it shouldn't
# have, like a password! When set true the error message will only show:
#   Rendering SLS 'my.sls' failed. Please see master log for details.
#pillar_safe_render_error: True

# The pillar_source_merging_strategy option allows you to configure merging strategy
# between different sources. It accepts four values: recurse, aggregate, overwrite,
# or smart. Recurse will merge recursively mapping of data. Aggregate instructs
# aggregation of elements between sources that use the #!yamlex renderer. Overwrite
# will verwrite elements according the order in which they are processed. This is
# behavior of the 2014.1 branch and earlier. Smart guesses the best strategy based
# on the "renderer" setting and is the default value.
#pillar_source_merging_strategy: smart
